The site has been designed to minimize security and privacy risks while still providing useful content, especially interactive code demonstrations and visualizations.  This page will be updated periodically as the content and features change.

**Static web pages** -- The content on this site consists of static web pages with embedded Javascript, mostly for math formatting, bibliographic citations and references, and also to edit and run WebPPL.  All of the Javascript runs on the "client", meaning in your browser on your device (desktop, laptop, mobile). Compared to actively-generated web pages (e.g. Wikipedia, Wordpress, etc.), static web pages (".html") are intrinsically more secure because there are many fewer ways for attackers to access data or programs on the web server.  Likewise, there are fewer ways for malicious code coming from the web server to do bad things to your browser or your computer.

**No user tracking** -- When you use this site, no user information goes to the web server, including programs you modify or create in the codeboxes or interactive editor.  We don't track any user activity while you are on the site.  We don't use cookies.  [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) is used in the search bar under the header. There is no advertising or advertising-related user tracking. This site does not access any information on your computer outside of the browser.

**Don't enter confidential or proprietary information** -- That said, it would be prudent for users to not enter any confidential or proprietary information (data or programs) into the codeboxes or interactive editor.  While this information stays within your browser (until you clear/erase history), there is a slight chance that an attacker could gain priviledged access to your browser, and therefore to the contents of the browser cache.
