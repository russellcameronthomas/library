Empirical Bayesian data analysis are an attractive alternative to frequentist methods, e.g. Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, linear regression, logistic regression, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Though there are specialized tools (e.g. STAN) for Bayesian data analysis, this use case shows the versitility and general applicablity of probabilistic programming.
