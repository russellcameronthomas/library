I started out on extending the code in the Team Negotiation model (production process), but got side-tracked on writting sections in the [Functional Programming](/fundamentals/2a-functional_programming.html) chapter. I had been meaning to add to this chapter as I discovered things (tips, tricks, pitfalls), but kept putting it off.  Ended up spending all my writing time on it.

In after hours coding, I did finally figure out how to enable code highlighting and alternate editors for non-*WedPPL* languages.  Win!
