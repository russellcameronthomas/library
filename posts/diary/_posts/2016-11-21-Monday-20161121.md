### Community Psychology

I discovered some very interesting literature in a field I had never heard of: Community Psychology.  reft:kelly_understanding_2012 provides a nice summary of the ecological approach they apply to treating and preventing psychological problems that have roots in community/social dynamics -- depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, etc.  This "therapeutic" orientation leads them toward a normative approach to community structures and institutions.  I made a PDF copy of reft:kelly_understanding_2012 from Google Books, thought it has some gaps in pages.
