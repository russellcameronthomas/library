To make progress on the ICED17 paper, I continued to modify and add to "[Negotiating Team Roles and Responsibilities](institutions/chapters/5-team_roles_and_responsibilities)" chapter, pushing the emphasis on the *framing process* early in a design project.  Got to the point where I could outline the computational model, but did not have time to make progress on it.
