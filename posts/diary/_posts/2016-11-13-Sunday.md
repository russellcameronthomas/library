I want to write some dissertation pages, but I haven't decided which ones or how much. I might start with putting in a bunch of stub sections and paragraphs as placeholders. I also want to build "Model Zero" in *WebPPL* for both the dissertation and Team Design projects.

I didn't do any coding on "Model Zero" or anything else, but I got some work done on the dissertation:

- Turned on "dissertation" option and fixed a bug by removing file name in header (not sure the cause).
- Created and initialized a Github repo for it (private).
- Edited the "Abstract" and "Introduction" chapter.  Mostly the "Introduction" still looks good, but I moved a bunch of stuff to Foundations chapter, including "Position in the Research Literature" and "Related Work".  

I consider the "Abstract" and "Introduction" chapter to be *done*, for now.

I also installed and tested a Mac-only PDF viewer (free, open source) called *[Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net)* that was designed for academics who want to markup a lot of PDFs.  It is the same PDF viewer used on TexShop, which is how I found it.  It has a *very cool* feature in conjunction with the `hyperref` package: when you hover over any hypertext link, a pop-up window appears that gives a *PDF rendered image* of the text that the link points to.  *Preview* doesn't do that.  I wonder if *Adobe Reader* has this capability.
