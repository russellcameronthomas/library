I was able to get syntax highlighting on this web site. Before, the *WebPPL* editor was treating all the `<pre><code>...</pre></code>` blocks as WebPPL code.  I change the Javascrtipt to only select if class = "language-webppl".  Now, prism.js can highlight all the other code in the appropriate language (*Javascript*, *Java*, *R*, *Scala*, CSS, etc.)
