Continued coding the stochastic *WebPPL* model for a simplified process design + production process for the Team Design project. Added matching function for Joints, and deduplication of both Lines and Joints, along with configuration constraints. Also added function to convert assembled Products into cannonical form to account for rotational symmetry.
