All of today and some of last night was spent installing and configuring a static search engine.  I was lucky enough to find a user's web site that had clear installation and configuration instructions, becaue the package author's wasn't very good.

Currently there is only an [Advanced Search](/search.html) page.  I'd like to have a quick search bar on every page, but that will take time for me to figure out how to put the results into a modal window so you don't automatically leave the page you are on.

For future enhancement, I'd like to have a snippet of text near the matching words, and maybe an match score.  I know the search engine calculates a match score.  I just need to figure out how to make it visible.

Also, I don't know if this handles literal strings in quotes.  If not, that will be another enhancement.

Finally, the search logic seems to use AND logic for a series of words.  Would be nice to have an option for OR logic, too.
