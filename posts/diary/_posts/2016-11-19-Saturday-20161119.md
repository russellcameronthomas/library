I wrote a long section in [Individual Performance in a Simple Functional Ecosystem](1a-individual-performance.html) on Functional Ecosystems. But it really belongs in a different chapter.  Good stuff, though.

I find that my writing productivity and effectivenss are highest if I allow myself to follow my thoughts and curiousity rather than force myself to stick to the original topic or writing plan.  This author's workbench helps me do that because I can easily rearrrange and reorganize what I write and there is a place for everything, even "off topic" things.
