## Russell Cameron Thomas

I am a Data Scientist at a Financial Institution, a PhD Candidate in Computational Data Science at George Mason University, and a Research Assistant at University of North Carolina Charlotte.

Focus: risk analysis, innovation ecosystem analysis, and Agent-based Modeling (ABM). Shameless crosser of boundaries and mixer of metaphors.
