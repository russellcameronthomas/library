<img class="resize" src="/assets/img/rct-staring-at-screen2.png" style="float:left; padding-right:20px; max-width:35%; height:auto;">**Russell Cameron Thomas** -- Data Scientist at a Financial Institution, a PhD Candidate in Computational Data Science at George Mason University, and a Research Assistant at University of North Carolina Charlotte.

Focus: risk analysis, innovation ecosystem analysis, and Agent-based Modeling (ABM). Shameless crosser of boundaries and mixer of metaphors.
