A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions.   Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed.  The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

  abstract = {This article assesses and extends Campbell's (1960) classic theory that creativity and discovery depend on blind variation and selective retention (BVSR), with special attention given to blind variations (BVs). The treatment begins by defining creativity and discovery, variant blindness versus sightedness, variant utility and selection, and ideational variants versus creative products. These definitions lead to BV identification criteria: (a) intended BV, which entails both systematic and stochastic combinatorial procedures; and (b) implied BV, which involves both variations with properties of blindness (variation superfluity and backtracking) and processes that should yield variant blindness (associative richness, defocused attention, behavioral tinkering, and heuristic search). These conceptual definitions and identification criteria then have implications for four persistent issues, namely, domain expertise, ideational randomness, analogical equivalence, and personal volition. Once BV is suitably conceptualized, Campbell's theory continues to provide a fruitful approach to the understanding of both creativity and discovery.},

  title = {Exploiting Compositionality to Explore a Large Space of Model Structures},
  abstract = {The recent proliferation of richly structured probabilistic models raises the question of how to automatically determine an appropriate model for a dataset. We investigate this question for a space of matrix decomposition models which can express a variety of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To enable model selection, we organize these models into a context-free grammar which generates a wide variety of structures through the compositional application of a few simple rules. We use our grammar to generically and efficiently infer latent components and estimate predictive likelihood for nearly 2500 structures using a small toolbox of reusable algorithms. Using a greedy search over our grammar, we automatically choose the decomposition structure from raw data by evaluating only a small fraction of all models. The proposed method typically finds the correct structure for synthetic data and backs off gracefully to simpler models under heavy noise. It learns sensible structures for datasets as diverse as image patches, motion capture, 20 Questions, and U.S. Senate votes, all using exactly the same code.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Institutional Logics Perspective}}},
  abstract = {How do institutions influence and shape cognition and action in individuals and organizations, and how are they in turn shaped by them? Various social science disciplines have offered a range of theories and perspectives to provide answers to this question. Within organization studies in recent years, several scholars have developed the institutional logics perspective. An institutional logic is the set of material practices and symbolic systems including assumptions, values, and beliefs by which individuals and organizations provide meaning to their daily activity, organize time and space, and reproduce their lives and experiences. This approach affords significant insights, methodologies, and research tools, to analyze the multiple combinations of factors that may determine cognition, behaviour, and rationalities. In tracing the development of the institutional logics perspective from earlier institutional theory, the book analyzes seminal research, illustrating how and why influential works on institutional theory motivated a distinct new approach to scholarship on institutional logics. The book shows how the institutional logics perspective transforms institutional theory. It presents novel theory, further elaborates the institutional logics perspective, and forges new linkages to key literatures on practice, identity, and social and cognitive psychology. It develops the microfoundations of institutional logics and institutional entrepreneurship, proposing a set of mechanisms that go beyond meta-theory, integrating this work with macro theory on institutional logics into a cross-levels model of cultural heterogeneity. By incorporating current psychological understanding of human behaviour and linking it to sociological perspectives, it aims to provide an encompassing framework for institutional analysis, and to be an essential and accessible reference for scholars and advanced students of organizational behaviour, organization and management theory, business strategy, and cultural sociology.},

  shorttitle = {When {{Flexible Routines Meet Flexible Technologies}}},
  abstract = {Employees in many contemporary organizations work with flexible routines and flexible technologies. When those employees find that they are unable to achieve their goals in the current environment, how do they decide whether they should change the composition of their routines or the materiality of the technologies with which they work? The perspective advanced in this paper suggests that the answer to this question depends on how human and material agencies-the basic building blocks common to both routines and technologies-are imbricated. Imbrication of human and material agencies creates infrastructure in the form of routines and technologies that people use to carry out their work. Routine or technological infrastructure used at any given moment is the result of previous imbrications of human and material agencies. People draw on this infrastructure to construct a perception that a technology either constrains their ability to achieve their goals, or that the technology affords the possibility of achieving new goals. The case of a computer simulation technology for automotive design used to illustrate this framework suggests that perceptions of constraint lead people to change their technologies while perceptions of affordance lead people to change their routines. This imbrication metaphor is used to suggest how a human agency approach to technology can usefully incorporate notions of material agency into its explanations of organizational change.},

We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to examine these questions. Our results, in identifying the boundary conditions around successful design efforts, suggest that the underlying architecture of complexity of organizations, particularly the presence of hierarchy, is a critical determinant of the feasibility and effectiveness of design efforts. We also find that design efforts are generally complementary to efforts at local performance improvement and identify specific contingencies that determine the extent of complementarity. We discuss the implications of our findings for organization theory and design and the literature on modularity in products and organizations.},

In it, you'll learn how to use the PP paradigm to model application domains and then express those probabilistic models in code. Although PP can seem abstract, in this book you'll immediately work on practical examples, like using the Figaro language to build a spam filter and applying Bayesian and Markov networks, to diagnose computer system data problems and recover digital images.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology The data you accumulate about your customers, products, and website users can help you not only to interpret your past, it can also help you predict your future! Probabilistic programming uses code to draw probabilistic inferences from data. By applying specialized algorithms, your programs assign degrees of probability to conclusions. This means you can forecast future events like sales trends, computer system failures, experimental outcomes, and many other critical concerns.  About the Book Practical Probabilistic Programming introduces the working programmer to probabilistic programming. In this book, you'll immediately work on practical examples like building a spam filter, diagnosing computer system data problems, and recovering digital images. You'll discover probabilistic inference, where algorithms help make extended predictions about issues like social media usage. Along the way, you'll learn to use functional-style programming for text analysis, object-oriented models to predict social phenomena like the spread of tweets, and open universe models to gauge real-life social media usage. The book also has chapters on how probabilistic models can help in decision making and modeling of dynamic systems.

The prediction of such change provides a significant challenge in the management of redesign and customization of complex products where many change propagation paths may be possible. This paper reports on an analysis of change behavior based on a case study in Westland Helicopters of rotorcraft design; the development of mathematical models to predict the risk of change propagation in terms of likelihood and impact of change; and the development of a prototype computer support tool to calculate such information for a specific product. With knowledge of likely change propagation paths and their impact on the delivery of the product, design effort can be directed towards avoiding change to ``expensive'' sub-systems and, where possible, allowing change where it is easier to implement while still achieving the overall changes required.},

  abstract = {The mechanistic view of ecosystem dynamics, being inherently reversible, seems ill-suited to describe directional behavior, such as ecosystem succession. A more conservative approach, such as one that involves probabilities, seems warranted. Work involving conditional probabilities has led to the development of a systems property called the ascendency, the increase of which appears to incorporate many of the changes that characterize the successional process. Ascendency originally was formulated entirely in terms of systems transactions. Hence, it did not address the crux of system dynamics, which is the connection between the stocks of taxa and the trophic flows between these populations. One may, however, expand the definition of system ascendency in a perfectly natural and consistent way to include compartmental biomasses. The principle of increasing ascendency, recast in terms of the new definition, provides a whole-system context for hitherto unexplained elements of traditional ecology. For example, the allometric trend during succession towards larger organisms with slower turnover times and the time-honored `Liebig's law of the minimum' both can be derived from the revised principle. Furthermore, the same derivational techniques provide us with an entirely new criterion for identifying the limiting nutrient linkages within an ecosystem. Such a theoretical `prediction' might augur the beginnings of a robust theoretical systems ecology},

Communication enables members to create equifinal meaning, from which organized action can follow.

  abstract = {A metaphor allows us to understand one concept in terms of another, enriching our mental imagery and imbuing concepts with meaningful attributes. Metaphors are well studied in design, for example, in branding, communication and the design of computer interfaces. Less well appreciated is that our understanding of fundamental design concepts, including design itself, is metaphorical. When we treat design as a process of exploration or when we get together to ``bounce ideas off each other'' we understand the abstract concepts of design and ideas metaphorically; ideas don't literally bounce, nor are we literally exploring when we design. Our research is a descriptive study of the metaphors employed in design. It is the first phase in a longer research effort to understand the impact of design metaphors on creativity. We investigated whether design authors employed different metaphors for the overall design process and consequently for core design concepts. To address this hypothesis we analyzed the language used in the concept generation chapters of nine widely used engineering design textbooks. We coded each metaphorical phrase, such as ``finding another route to a solution'', and determined the core metaphors in use for common design concepts including, ideas, problems, solutions, concepts, design, the design process, user needs and others. We confirmed that authors with differing views of design do indeed emphasize different metaphors for core design concepts. We close by discussing the implications of some common metaphors, in particular that Ideas Are Physical Objects.},

Retrieving concepts from metaphors demands creative thinking. While the importance of this heuristic has been acknowledged in design, more research is needed to appreciate its contribution to design practice. This investigation aims to assess metaphor use by students in design problem solving, with a particular focus on design creativity. Relationships between factors of creativity and factors of metaphors were submitted for statistical analyses. Findings show that innovation is the most significant factor characterizing design creativity, followed by utility and aesthetics. On the other hand, the synthesis of design solutions is the stronger factor of the use of metaphors, and conceptual thinking the weakest. Results also demonstrate that metaphors play an important role in design creativity. Analysis of design problems was the predictor that had a unique contribution to innovation and general creativity.},

These case studies form the basis of four themes to help teams navigate the new product development process.},

However, little is known about the interactions and activities that reveal frames and support frame sharing in teams.

We used a mixed method, interdisciplinary approach to understand the dynamic process through which design frames are socially negotiated and shared.

  title = {Information {{Sharing Tools}} and {{Behavior}} in {{Collaborative Human}}-{{Centered Design Teams}}},
  abstract = {Developing innovative products and services benefits from collaboration within multidisciplinary design teams. Design teams gather and generate large quantities of data, including user research, information on competing products and applicable technologies, and new design ideas; however, teams often struggle to synthesize this diverse design information. Collaboration can break down if they cannot form a shared understanding of the design problem. This dissertation examines current design practices to construct theoretical models of the design process and to develop new tools to help design teams create, communicate, and collaborate. It explores how information tools are used to support collaborative design processes, and suggests forms for future tools. It presents a series of qualitative research studies, i.e., survey and interviews with professional and student designers as well as observations of face-to-face student design team meetings. The analysis of surveys and interviews with professional designers offer a descriptive characterization of how design teams use technology to share information with each other in practice. These studies also inform a new conceptual framework--the \emph{sharing spiral}-- that describes how information is shared throughout individual and collaborative design tasks, across user research and conceptual design phases. With this new framework guiding qualitative analysis of observations of face-to-face student design team meetings, nine challenges to information sharing are identified. This dissertation proposes design guidelines for new design collaboration technology, based on these challenges. Finally, it applies these guidelines to a new system, \emph{Dazzle}. Dazzle is an information sharing tool for face-to-face design teams that allows teammates to share, log, and annotate shared design resources. This dissertation offers a new understanding of information sharing in design practice, and has implications for improving design practice and the development of future design tools.},

It shares common interests with many other approaches to information and organisations, such as computer science, computational semiotics, organisational engineering, and language action perspective. The common vision shared by these approaches is to treat organisations and related information systems and technologies within a unified semiotic framework, with particular reference to the huge range of issues that elude many traditional disciplines. The analysis and design of information systems develops methods for solving the practical problems but offers no rigorous, theoretical foundation for them or how information functions within and between organisations. The semiotic perspective accommodates the individual and the social, the human and the technical, intra- and inter-organisational interactions, at a level of detail that is required in the study, modelling, design, and engineering of new and alternative organisational and technical systems.

Communicating the reasoning processes that underlie a finding is one method for enhancing interpretation, and can result in more effective evaluation and application of shared knowledge. In knowledge management tools, interpretation is aided by creating knowledge artifacts that can expose their provenance to scrutiny and that can be transformed into diverse representations that suit their consumers' perspectives and preferences. We outline the information management needs of inquiring communities characterized by hypothesis generation tasks, and propose a model for communication, based in theories of hermeneutics, semiotics, and abduction, in which knowledge structures can be decomposed into the lower-level reasoning artifacts that produced them.

  abstract = {In The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction, Clarisse Sieckenius deSouza proposes an account of HCI that draws on concepts from semiotics and computer science toinvestigate the relationship between user and designer. Semiotics is the study of signs, and theessence of semiotic engineering is the communication between designers and users at interactiontime; designers must somehow be present in the interface to tell users how to use the signs thatmake up a system or program. This approach, which builds on -- but goes further than -- thecurrently dominant user-centered approach, allows designers to communicate their overall vision andtherefore helps users understand designs -- rather than simply which icon to click.According to deSouza's account, both designers and users are interlocutors in an overall communication process thattakes place through an interface of words, graphics, and behavior. Designers must tell users whatthey mean by the artifact they have created, and users must understand and respond to what they arebeing told. By coupling semiotic theory and engineering, de Souza's approach to HCI designencompasses the principles, the materials, the processes, and the possibilities for producingmeaningful interactive computer system discourse and achieves a broader perspective than cognitive,ethnographic, or ergonomic approaches.De Souza begins with a theoretical overview and detailedexposition of the semiotic engineering account of HCI. She then shows how this approach can beapplied specifically to HCI evaluation and design of online help systems, customization and end-userprogramming, and multiuser applications. Finally, she reflects on the potential and opportunitiesfor research in semiotic engineering.},

Where should we look for it? How should we study it? As is true for most cultural phenomena, organisations are markedly elusive. They cannot be treated as empirical entities. What you perceive, when `looking' at organisations, are artefacts (buildings, machines) and behaviour (linguistic and other). However, neither artefacts, nor behaviour are `organisation-like' in themselves. What is needed, therefore, is something that relates artefacts and behaviour to create a more or less coherent whole. Such a relation is a representation, shared, at least in part, by a number of interacting actors. It is the representation that gives both artefacts and behaviour their meaning. Clearly, we take representations (`symbols') not only as referring to something mental activities act upon, but as a specific type of mental activity, also referred to as `cognition'. If anywhere, therefore, an organisation resides in the mental activities of actors.},

It is shown that if the design problem at hand is ``complex'' (in terms of interdependencies between the elements of the system), then a decentralized institutional structure is unlikely ever to generate optimal solutions and, therefore, no selection process can ever select them. We also show that nearly-decomposable structures have, in general, a selective advantage in terms of speed in reaching (good) locally optimal solutions.},

  isbn = {978-94-010-3986-4 978-94-010-0161-8},
  abstract = {This chapter explains how models function as the glue that keeps organizations together. In an analysis of models from a semiotic and cognitive point of view, assumptions about evolutionary dynamics and bounded rationality are used. It is concluded that a model is a coherent sign structure, consisting of a network of a diversity of signs, and used by an actor for understanding or constructing a system of application. People use models because they are coherent, cognitively manageable units of knowledge. By their efficient organization, these knowledge units enable the development of flexible and adequate habits of action. In an investigation into the complexity, coherence, boundaries, and components of models, assumptions about construction, emergence, and the coherence mechanism are used. Based on their use, models develop semiotic shortcuts in the form of new sign layers to the representation, namely iconic representations, language representations, and conceptual representations. Models change and find their boundaries based on a dynamics of coherence. The coherence mechanism must be seen as an alternative for foundational reasoning and fits well into an open, constructivist world view. In an explanation of the role of models in organizations, assumptions about methodological individualism and distribution of knowledge are used. An organization is seen as a multi-actor system based on habits of action aimed at cooperation and coordination of work. These habits of action are supported by organizational knowledge in the form of shared artefacts, stories, institutions, designs and plans. Shared institutions, designs and plans can be seen as shared normative models that make up for the difference between the organization as a whole and `the sum of the individual actors. They are the glue that keeps the system together. Shared normative models are created by actors and, in turn, influence actor behaviour by forming habits, thus creating a cycle of selection and reinforcement, where some models and norms are reinforced and other models and norms disappear.},

  abstract = {In this paper we sketch a framework for multi-actor simulation of organisations. This framework elaborates the interaction and cooperation of actors based on social constructs. Because of the demands of the task environment, in which tasks often cannot be done alone, actors have to cooperate. Cooperation is only possible based on intertwined habits and mutual commitments that are expressed in sign structures, such as agreements, contracts and plans. At a semiotical level of description, these sign structures are seen as social constructs. Social constructs guide the formation and reinforcement of habits of individual actors that are aimed at cooperation, coordination and socially accepted behaviour. In contrast to many approaches to multi-actor simulation, we design the actors as cognitively plausible actors. We use the cognitive architecture ACT-R for modelling the individual actors. This cognitive architecture implements a part of Simon's bounded rationality. In the recent discussion about bounded rationality, fast and frugal heuristics play an important role. Some of these heuristics will be included in the simulation model as a compensation mechanism for the limits to rationality.},

  shorttitle = {Bounded {{Semiotics}}},
  abstract = {In this chapter a frontal attack on classical semiotic approaches is formulated. Contemporary semiotics can be defined as a speculative and descriptive discourse based on a tradition of argumentation and intuitive evidence. It relies only indirectly on experimentation through the occasional use of meta-analysis to support its arguments. This semiotic endeavor is called ``semiotics as utopia''. Part of this approach is its fundamental trust in ultimate or optimal rationality. In this chapter a plea is given for rethinking rationality along evolutionary lines. This seems to be a relatively recent epistemological endeavor. Herbert Simon coined the term ``bounded rationality'' in the mid-1950s. This notion of bounded rationality is used to formulate what I call ``bounded semiotics''. This should be concerned with the adaptive shortcuts, which evolved with respect to efficient (that is, fast and accurate) sorting out of relevant information and adaptive decision-making, rather than with the complex logical architectures, which purport to theorize (i.e., make intelligibly visible) an assumed universal semiotic competence. Examples of shortcuts are a) innate releasing mechanisms, b) imitation or copying, c) stereotyping and d) emotions. The notion of ``boundedness'' can also be applied to organizational theory, resulting in what I like to call ``bounded organizations''.},

Our species was not the first to do so, because birds have also complex evolving sound repertoires. But it is one distinguishing feature with respect to other hominid species such as chimpanzees (Lieberman, 1991). Second, we must explain how sounds, gestures, or other physical signs can be given meaning, in other words how a semiotic system may arise. The songs of birds do not carry meaning. Even though gestures or sounds used by chimpanzees might, they do not appear to productively associate an open-ended set of meanings with an open-ended set of forms. Third, we must explain the emergence of grammar: how compositional form can be associated with compositional meaning. This chapter focuses only on the second part, the emergence of semiotic systems.},

  title = {Understanding the {{Process}} of {{Economic Change}}},
  isbn = {0-691-14595-4},
  abstract = {In this landmark work, a Nobel Prize-winning economist develops a new way of understanding the process by which economies change. Douglass North inspired a revolution in economic history a generation ago by demonstrating that economic performance is determined largely by the kind and quality of institutions that support markets. As he showed in two now classic books that inspired the New Institutional Economics (today a subfield of economics), property rights and transaction costs are fundamental determinants. Here, North explains how different societies arrive at the institutional infrastructure that greatly determines their economic trajectories.  North argues that economic change depends largely on "adaptive efficiency," a society's effectiveness in creating institutions that are productive, stable, fair, and broadly accepted--and, importantly, flexible enough to be changed or replaced in response to political and economic feedback. While adhering to his earlier definition of institutions as the formal and informal rules that constrain human economic behavior, he extends his analysis to explore the deeper determinants of how these rules evolve and how economies change. Drawing on recent work by psychologists, he identifies intentionality as the crucial variable and proceeds to demonstrate how intentionality emerges as the product of social learning and how it then shapes the economy's institutional foundations and thus its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances.  Understanding the Process of Economic Change accounts not only for past institutional change but also for the diverse performance of present-day economies. This major work is therefore also an essential guide to improving the performance of developing countries.},
