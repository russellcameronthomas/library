This is just scratch code to show that ps.js works on this workbench.

Normal WebPPL:

~~~~

var d = "this is a test";

print(d);

~~~~

Here is some formatted code:

<pre class="language-javascript">
<code class="language-javascript">var note = "this is formatted code!";</code></pre>   
<pre class="language-css">
<code class="language-css">p { color: red }</code></pre>

Here is an iframe with p5.js embedded:

<iframe src="/assets/p5/embed.html" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>


The end!
