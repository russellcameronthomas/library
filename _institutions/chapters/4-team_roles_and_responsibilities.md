This is a model of self-organizing teams -- specifically small teams of design engineers ("agents") -- but it could be any type of team doing any type of work. It draws on two other models -- [Affordances as Probabilistic Interrelations](1_affordances.html) and [Evolving Team Structure](2-team_structure.html) -- but goes beyond them to include higher-order reasoning about the tasks, each agent's capabilities, and probable outcomes given ways of assigning roles and responsibilities.  The base model involves agents reasoning privately.  The extended model adds *institutions* -- norms and rules -- that influence and constrain agent choices and behaviors.

The goal of this model is to study the effects of team member migration.  Agents on a given team become aculturated to that team, including its institutions.  When an agent moves to a new team with different culture and institutions, conflicts can arise. Is this conflict positive or negative?  How does it affect team versatility and creativity?  Is it a temporary disturbance or a permanent change?  If new members challenge or reconfigure the team's 'institutions, are the effects positive, negative, or mixed?
