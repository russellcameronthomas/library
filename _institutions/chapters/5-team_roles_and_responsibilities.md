This is a model of self-organizing teams -- specifically small teams of design engineers ("actors") -- but it could be any type of team doing any type of work. It draws on prevous models:

- [Affordances as Probabilistic Interrelations](1_affordances.html)
- [Individual Performance in a Functional Ecosystem](1a-individual_performance.html)
- [Evolving Team Structure](2-team_structure.html)
- [Model of Institutions Via Affordances](3c-model.html)
- [The Feast Table Model](/incentives/chapters/1-feast.html)

However, the model here goes beyond them to include higher-order reasoning about the tasks, each actor's capabilities, and probable outcomes given ways of assigning roles and responsibilities.  The base model involves actors reasoning privately.  The extended model adds *institutions* -- norms and rules -- that influence and constrain actor choices and behaviors.

The goal of this model is to study the effects of team member migration.  Actors on a given team become aculturated to that team, including its institutions.  When an actor moves to a new team with different culture and institutions, conflicts can arise. Is this conflict positive or negative?  How does it affect team versatility and creativity?  Is it a temporary disturbance or a permanent change?  If new members challenge or reconfigure the team's 'institutions, are the effects positive, negative, or mixed?

## Social Learning and Performance Cycle

Here is a sketch of the cycle of learning and performance that we will be modeling:

1. A team forms by recruiting and selecting individual designers based on their relevant skills and experience, compared to perceived needs and roles; 
2. Team members decide on roles and responsibility by some governance/social process.
3. The team starts working together and team members interact with each other, and also with any explicit rules and norms for the team; 
4. Individual team members learn by doing as they perform their daily work, and also learn through explicit instruction and through social interaction.
5. Gradually team members become acculturated in the team’s norms and patterns, which shape and are shaped by individual learning. 
6. Along the way (i.e. during steps 1 through 5) one or more “interactional frames” are developed (maybe tacitly) that define an abstract structure and give meaning to the way the team works (both positive and negative aspects); 
7. These interactional frames become institutionalized, and some team members become strongly affiliated with them (or against them, if they are perceived to be failures).
8. Team members migrate to new teams (step 1), carrying with them everything they have learned and internalized from this team.

## Actor Interests

Contrary to Neo-classical Economics and modern Game Theory, we will *not* be modeling the interests of actors using a generalized/aggregate subjective utility metric.  Instead, we will adopt the model situational cognitive + social "interests", as developed in the [The Feast Table Model](/incentives/chapters/1-feast.html).  In some cases it will work like subjective utility maximization but other times it won't.

## Constructs from Functional Ecosystems

We'll use the definitions of constructs from Functional Ecology described in [Model of Institutions Via Affordances](3c-model.html).  These include (alphabetically):

- Affordances
- Capabilities
- Functions
- Routines
- Situations

## Actor Reasoning about their Functional Ecosystem

The key feature of this model is Actor reasoning about their functional ecosystem in two situations: 1) negotiating a division of responsibilities (a mapping of to Actors) and 2) negotiating resolutions to design decision conflicts that arise during a design project.

**To Do**

1. Add characteristics to each task that are interpreted as signs, symbols, and signals during task performance.
1. Add to actors: differential skills in performing tasks (capabilities + routines)
1. Add to actors: conception of their capabilities + routines, related to "getting the job done"
    * Maybe this could be in some mental frame construct
1. Add memoization to performance landscape to save time on initialization and allow larger problems
1. Add performance correlation between tasks according to the similarity of their characteristics.
