This is a model of individual performance in a functional ecosystem.  This is a *very simple* ecoystem, consisting of a single Actor and a "project" consisting of a small set of tasks.  The point of such a simple system is to use it as a stepping stone to more complex models.

## Actor Learning and Performance Cycle

Here is a sketch of the Actor's cycle of learning and performances that we will be modeling.

1. The Actor comes to the project endowed with a set of skills and experience that are relevant to perceived needs of the project.
2. The Actor assesses the tasks and decides (consciously or unconsciously) how to approach them.  This *approach* constitutes both the "framing" (i.e. "the story about how this project will be performed by this Actor") and "frame" (i.e. the Actor's '"cognitive schema") that will be deployed, and also the Actor's expectations.
    - The "approach" also includes organizing the tasks into a sequence, a hierarchy, or otherwise composing or decomposing them into "chunks" of activity. 
3. The Actor starts working on tasks, applying the chosen routines (i.e. processes, procedures, tools, methods). The course of work is guided by making decisions in a goal-subgoal tree, and reasoning about alternative choices at each decision point.
4. During the course of work, the Actor *creates information* through engagement with the *affordances* in the task environment and artifacts. This engagement includes literal or imaginary manipulation, *semiotic perception and conception* processes, and *abduction*. This information created in this way becomes *instrumental* in guiding further activity and for handling unforseen contingencies or exceptions.
    - The "semiotic processes" here are aligned with the construct of "sensemaking".
    - There is a coevolution between the Actor's conception of the problem space (tasks, goals, challenges) and the solution space.
    - There are two types of crucial information: fulfillment of expectations and progress. If expectations are met, then the current framing and frame are reinforced.  If expectations are not met, especially in surprising ways, then framing and frame are adjusted or replaced to "make sense" of the unfolding state of affairs.  If progress is sufficient or better, then the current course is reinforced. If progress is insufficient, then more effort/resource may be applied, or perhaps there will be reframming.
5. The Actor may start to codify and/or abstract (generalize) her knowledge about the task and task performance. This knowledge may be embedded in *knowledge artifacts* that become instrumental to the Actor going forward. (They are "knowledge artifacts" because they are *functionally significant* for the Actor to manifest and put to use the Actor's knowledge in some specific situation.)
    - An important class of knowledge artifacts are sketches, prototypes, mockups, and simulations.
    - Another important class of knowledge artifacts are design documents, notes, photos, journals, instructions, etc. that recorde specifics about the task performance along the way and contribute toward the end product.
    - Another important class are "proto-institutions": norms and rules that the Actor formulates and begins to follow.
7. At some point, the Actor decides that work is complete on each task, either because the results are satisfactory, the goal is reached, or some constraint has been reached (time, energy, resources, effort). (Return to Step 1 to start a new set of tasks)

## Types of Ignorance and Uncertainty

Here is a list of the possible varieties of ignorance and uncertainty our Actor may encounter during the course of project work:

- Ambiguity
- Imprecision, Non-specificity, over-simplification
- Vagueness, Fuzziness
- Variability, Instability, Inconsistency, Noise
- Incommensurability
- Infeasablility
- Paradoxical (i.e. self-defeating, self-refuting)
- Error
- Misinterpretation, indecipherability, Over-interpretation
- Non-sequitor

Actors use their reasoning, action, and interaction capabilities along with the informational resources extracted from affordances in the task environment to cope with and resolve these ignorances and uncertainties.  In particular, the knowledge artifacts created along the way, including "proto-institutions" are prime instruments for progressively resolving ignorance and uncertainty in order to make decisions and achieve (sub)goals.

## Proto-institutions

Though we cannot say that there are institutions at work in a simple single Actor ecosystem, we can located the precursors of institutions, a.k.a. proto-institutions.  These are norms and rules that the Actor creates for herself.

### Habits and Conditioned Responses

These constitute *reflexive reasoning* inside the Actor -- actions without any conscious thinking. They arise purely as a response to internal or environmental queues and situations, conditioned by past behavior and experiences.  If the Actor is mistaken, and the environment does *not* match what is expected, then the habit or conditioned response "fails", and the Actor needs to recover by reacting differently or doing something differently.

While it is tempting to call these "proto-institutions" because they are "taken for granted", I believe they do not qualify.  They may be the raw material, but they lack the structure, coherence, and instrumentality that we expect from institutions. They only become "visible" to the Actor in their failure. In particular, habits and conditioned responses do *not* reduce uncertainty or ignorance on the part of the Actor who enacts them. Quite the reverse. They depend on certainty, predictablity, and lack of surprises.

### Personal Norms and Rules â‡’ Intrinsic Reward System 

Personal norms and rules constitute the Actor's intrinsic reward system -- self-created, self-governed, and self-reinforced. These norms and rules function *almost* the same as norms and rules in multi-actor social settings, but not quite, which is what qualifies these as *proto-institutions*.

Of course personal norms and rules build on and extend the Actors instinctive, "inborn" reward system. But we'll see below how they are different.

What is crucial about personal norms and rules is that the Actor holds the *recipe* for constituting and enacting them.  This recipe is tied up in the framing and cognitive schema of the Actor, and also habits and conditioned responses (i.e. serving as "raw material", as noted in the previous subsection). This is a vital difference between intrinsic and external rewards (and penalties).  An Actor's intrinsic reward system is *interwoven* in the Actor's beliefs, and in the way the Actor thinks, sees, reacts, and behaves, including percieved options and choices available.  In contrast, external rewards (and penalties) sit outside of most of this, and are always experienced as Other, constituted and controlled from the outside, and therefore not as malliable and frequently inscrutible.

### Three Cannonical Intrinsic Rewards: <br/> 1) Progress, 2) Significant Surprise, and 3) Frustration

These three are not the only common or cannonical intrinsic rewards, but I believe they are both common and central to performing conceptual/informationa/abstract tasks. In other words, it vital that the Actor have some ways to gauge progress, lack of progress, signs that indicate possible changes of direction, and excess expenditure of resources.  In physical tasks, these are fairly obvious and immediate for an organism in neuro-physical sensations, but in an conceptual/informationa/abstract tasks these reward signals need to be synthesized by the Actor through engagement with the task environment.

Consider the game of chess played by two intermediate players.  Player A is midway through a particular chess opening and is setting a strategy for the middle game.  As the game unfolds, how can Player A tell whether or not she is making progress on this strategy?  There may be intermediate goal states in terms of move sequences or partial piece positions, or their may be something less specific having to do with the overall shape and tempo of the game (e.g. who has initiative).

Now what happens when Player B makes a move or two that were completely unexpected by A, and maybe moves that appear to be irrational (as A imagines B to be thinking)?  This is *ambigous* because it could be a sign (indicator) of very different possibilities: either 1) B is making a blunder or 1) B has discovered a fatal flaw in A's strategy and is now exploiting it through these moves that "don't make sense" to A. If Player A does not have some intrinsic reward system for detecting and responding to *significant surprises*, this set of unexpected events would not receive sufficient salience or reflection.

Let's say that Player A responds by rethinking her whole strategy, and starts thinking through completely new strategies and lines of play by both players.  How much time and effort should she spend on this?  How much time should she spend on rethinking lines of play that she has already considered and rejected?  Especially if Player A is on the verge of believing that her original strategy and reasoning were mistaken?

At some point during this process, Player A must be able to sense the penalty of *frustration*, where progress in any line of analysis is exceeded by the costs in term of time and attention.  Notice how a *utilitarian* calculation (costs vs benefits) as come into being.  I believe that utilitarian formulations and calculations *arise from situations* and do not proceed in the background on a continuous basis to govern decisions and behavior.

Notice that in all three of these cases in the chess game, Player A was drawing information from the task environment through *semiotic processes* -- i.e. seeing and interpreting signs, and incorporating those perceptions and interpretations in how she was thinking and planning.  Also, the task enviroment (primarily the board postion) provides *affordances* for a variety of strategies or ploys (i.e. combinations of moves that have some near-term purpose or even "trick", like gaining some material advantage, or "pinning" a major piece so it can't move). Even more, the moves of Player B provide both affordances and signs that Player A might be able to utilize, depending on her skills and current position/resources.

Of course, there is reasoning in chess that is not primarily semiotic, i.e. imagining sequences of moves and counter moves, and the relative merits of positions after those sequences.
