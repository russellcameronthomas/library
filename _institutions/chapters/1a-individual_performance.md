This is a model of individual performance in a functional ecosystem.  This is a *very simple* ecoystem, consisting of a single Actor and a "project" consisting of a small set of tasks.  The point of such a simple system is to use it as a stepping stone to more complex models.

## Actor Learning and Performance Cycle

Here is a sketch of the Actor's cycle of learning and performances that we will be modeling.

1. The Actor comes to the project endowed with a set of skills and experience that are relevant to perceived needs of the project.
2. The Actor assesses the tasks and decides (consciously or unconsciously) how to approach them.  This *approach* constitutes both the "framing" (i.e. "the story about how this project will be performed by this Actor") and "frame" (i.e. the Actor's '"cognitive schema") that will be deployed, and also the Actor's expectations.
    - The "approach" also includes organizing the tasks into a sequence, a hierarchy, or otherwise composing or decomposing them into "chunks" of activity.
3. The Actor starts working on tasks, applying the chosen routines (i.e. processes, procedures, tools, methods). The course of work is guided by making decisions in a goal-subgoal tree, and reasoning about alternative choices at each decision point.
4. During the course of work, the Actor *creates information* through engagement with the *affordances* in the task environment and artifacts. This engagement includes literal or imaginary manipulation, *semiotic perception and conception* processes, and *abduction*. This information created in this way becomes *instrumental* in guiding further activity and for handling unforseen contingencies or exceptions.
    - The "semiotic processes" here are aligned with the construct of "sensemaking".
    - There is a coevolution between the Actor's conception of the problem space (tasks, goals, challenges) and the solution space.
    - There are two types of crucial information: fulfillment of expectations and progress. If expectations are met, then the current framing and frame are reinforced.  If expectations are not met, especially in surprising ways, then framing and frame are adjusted or replaced to "make sense" of the unfolding state of affairs.  If progress is sufficient or better, then the current course is reinforced. If progress is insufficient, then more effort/resource may be applied, or perhaps there will be reframming.
5. The Actor may start to codify and/or abstract (generalize) her knowledge about the task and task performance. This knowledge may be embedded in *knowledge artifacts* that become instrumental to the Actor going forward. (They are "knowledge artifacts" because they are *functionally significant* for the Actor to manifest and put to use the Actor's knowledge in some specific situation.)
    - An important class of knowledge artifacts are sketches, prototypes, mockups, and simulations.
    - Another important class of knowledge artifacts are design documents, notes, photos, journals, instructions, etc. that recorde specifics about the task performance along the way and contribute toward the end product.
    - Another important class are "proto-institutions": norms and rules that the Actor formulates and begins to follow.
7. At some point, the Actor decides that work is complete on each task, either because the results are satisfactory, the goal is reached, or some constraint has been reached (time, energy, resources, effort). (Return to Step 1 to start a new set of tasks)

## Types of Ignorance and Uncertainty

Here is a list of the possible varieties of ignorance and uncertainty our Actor may encounter during the course of project work:

- Ambiguity
- Imprecision, Non-specificity, over-simplification
- Vagueness, Fuzziness
- Variability, Instability, Inconsistency, Noise
- Incommensurability
- Infeasablility
- Paradoxical (i.e. self-defeating, self-refuting)
- Error
- Misinterpretation, indecipherability, Over-interpretation
- Non-sequitor

Actors use their reasoning, action, and interaction capabilities along with the informational resources extracted from affordances in the task environment to cope with and resolve these ignorances and uncertainties.  In particular, the knowledge artifacts created along the way, including "proto-institutions" are prime instruments for progressively resolving ignorance and uncertainty in order to make decisions and achieve (sub)goals.

## Proto-institutions

Though we cannot say that there are institutions at work in a simple single Actor ecosystem, we can located the precursors of institutions, a.k.a. proto-institutions.  These are norms and rules that the Actor creates for herself.

### Habits and Conditioned Responses

These constitute *reflexive reasoning* inside the Actor -- actions without any conscious thinking. They arise purely as a response to internal or environmental queues and situations, conditioned by past behavior and experiences.  If the Actor is mistaken, and the environment does *not* match what is expected, then the habit or conditioned response "fails", and the Actor needs to recover by reacting differently or doing something differently.

While it is tempting to call these "proto-institutions" because they are "taken for granted", I believe they do not qualify.  They may be the raw material, but they lack the structure, coherence, and instrumentality that we expect from institutions.  In particular, habits and conditioned responses do *not* reduce uncertainty or ignorance on the part of the Actor who enacts them. (See list above.)

### Personal Norms and Rules â‡’ Intrinsic Reward System 

Personal norms and rules constitute the Actor's intrinsic reward system -- self-created, self-governed, and self-reinforced. These norms and rules function *almost* the same as norms and rules in multi-actor social settings, but not quite, which is what qualifies these as *proto-institutions*.
